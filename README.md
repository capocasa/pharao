Pharao - quick 'n easy Nim web programming 
==========================================

Pharao is for quick 'n easy web programming.

Start up a pharao server (once) and point it at a web root.

Place a Nim file anywhere in the web root. Then open that path in the browser. Pharao will compile your file into a request handler and call it.

If this sounds familiar, it's because it's the only thing the author missed about programming in PHP.

Basic Usage
-----------

Install pharao using nimble

```
$ nimble install pharao
```

Run it.

```
$ export PHARAO_WEB_ROOT=/var/www  # optional
$ pharao
```

Create a Nim file somewhere in the web root. 

```nim
# /var/www/hello.nim
echo "Hello, ancient world!"
```

Call it. Voila!

```
$ curl localhost:2347/hello.nim
Hello, ancient world!
```

Simple examples
---------------

You can write any nim code
```nim
# /var/www/rando.nim
import std/random

randomize()

body.add "I'm a rando.\n\n"
body.add $rand(10000)
body.add "\n|
```

```
$ curl localhost:2347/rando.nim
I'm a rando.

4592
```

You can use source code filters

```nim
#? stdtmpl
## /var/www/scf.nim
# import std/random
# let r = random(10000)
I'm a rando.

$r
```

```
$ curl localhost:2347/scf.nim
I'm a rando.

7917
```

You can use templating engines

```nim
# /var/www/template.nim
import std/random, nimja/parser
randomize()

let battleCry = ["Hee", "Hoo", "Haa-ya"].sample
compileTemplateStr """
I'm a Nimja

{{ battleCry }}!
"""
```

```
$ curl localhost:2347/nimja.nim
```
I'm a Nimja

Haa-ya!
```

Reading data
------------

You can set headers and request variables

```nim
headers["Content-Type"] = "text/plain"
body = "Yowzy\n"
code = 409
```

```
$ curl -i localhost:2347/yowzy.nim
HTTP/1.1 409
Content-Type: text/plain
Content-Length: 5

Yowzy
```

You can check out the get parameters

```nim
# /var/www/query.nim
body.add request.queryParams.getOrDefault("a", "empty") & "\n"
```

```nim
$ curl localhost:2347/query.nim?a=b
b
```

Or post parameters 

```nim
# /var/www/form.nim
let params = request.body.parseSearch:
echo params.getOrDefault("foo", "-")
```

```
$ curl -d foo=bar localhost:2347/query.nim
bar
```

You may prefer multipart, as in `<form enctype='multipart/form-data'`

```nim
# /var/www/multi.nim
for m in request.decodeMultipart:
  if m.data.isSome:
    let (a, z) = m.data.get
    body.add request.body[a..z]
    body.add "\n"
```

```
$ curl -F foo=bar localhost:2347/multi.nim
bar
```

multipart supports file uploads

```
$ echo foo > /tmp/foo.txt
$ curl -F uploadme=@/tmp/foo.txt localhost:2347/multi.nim
foo
# the server just returns file content but could store
# in on disk or in database
```

Fancy
-----

You can keep doing stuff after the request.

```nim
# /var/www/stayingalive.nim
import os, times
body = "done " & $now() & "\n"
let f = open("/tmp/later.log", fmWrite)
respond()
sleep 1000
f.writeLine($now() & " is one second after the request!\n")
f.close
body = "blackhole"  # this doesn't do anything any more
```

```
$ curl localhost:2347/stayingalive.nim & && tail -f /tmp/later.log
done

```

More than one file
------------------

Use includes to easily have different files

```nim
# /var/www/this.nim

echo "this"

include that
```

```nim
# /var/www/that.nim

echo "that"
```

```sh
$ localhost:2347/this.nim
this
that
```

Imports work too.

If you want to use pharao's variables in imported files, add `import pharao/tools`.
This is not necessary if you have no side effects (recommended) or use includes.

```nim
# /var/www/imp.nim
import imped
foo()
```

```nim
# /var/www/imped.nim
import pharao/tools
proc foo*() =
  echo "I was imported!!!\n"
```

```
# curl localhost:2347/imp.nim
I was imported!!!
```


.. warning::
  For security, keep your imports and includes out of your web root (recommended) or make sure the module scope doesn't do anything.

This is ok

```nim
# /var/www/iimport.nim

import importme

```

```nim
# /var/www/importme.nim

proc foo() =
  echo "foo"

# no side effects here, just definitions

```

This is also ok

```nim
# /var/app/importme2.nim

# /var/app could be any directory that is not in the web root

# side effect here
echo "foobar fuz buz"

```

```nim
# /var/www/iimport2.nim

import ../app/importme2"

```

This is not ok

```nim
# /var/www/badidea.nim
import pharao/tools
echo "sensitive user data"

```

```nim
# /var/www/importer3.nim

if request.headers.getOrDefault("Authorization", "") != "Bearer my-secure-token":
  code = 401
  body = unauthorized
  return

import badidea

```

Because then anyone can do

```nim
$ curl localhost:2347/importer3.nim
unauthorized
$ curl localhost:2347/badidea.nim
sensitive user data
$ # whoops
```

Storing data
------------

You can use "global" variables. They only get written when your code is compiled or the server is restarted.

```nim
# /var/www/persist.nim

proc calculate(): int =
  # stand-in for something that takes a while 
  2 + 2 

let num {.global.} = calculate()  # calculate is only run once

body = $num

```

This is also great way to set up a database connection, such as [LimDB](https://github.com/capocasa/limdb).

```
$ nimble install limdb
```

```nim
import limdb

let db {.global.} = initDb("foo.db")

db["text"].add(".")  # this is both in-memory and on disk now
body = db["text"]

```

.. info ::
    every pharao program runs inside one of a fixed number worker threads, which are sub-programs that run within pharao and have access to the same data. If you mark a variable `{.global.}` to keep it around to make your program faster, you have to make sure that any changes to that variable are done in a "thread safe" way.

    The easiest way to have thread safety is to use libraries that already are written that way, as LimDB is. Just use it.



Sometimes it's more useful for each worker to have its own copy of a variable that gets re-used each time a request is handled by that worker. That way, you have about 40 copies of the variable, but no more.

The sqlite3 database expects to be use this way.

Mark the variable as a thread-local variable- or `{.threadvar.}`


```nim
import db_connector/db_sqlite, random
randomize()
var data = "asdf"
data.shuffle()

# can't do this, has to be on two lines
# var db {. threadvar .} = open("foo.db", "", "", "")
var db {. threadvar .}: DbConn
db = open("foo.db", "", "", "")

db.exec sql" INSERT INTO foo (foo) VALUES (?) ", data

headers["Content-Type"] = "text/tsv"
for row in db.fastRows sql" SELECT * FROM foo":
  echo row[0], "\t", row[1]
```

And a minimal, but workable script to create and maintain your database.

```nim
# /var/www/initdb-av0k2ja15v2347rbwchexz48.nim
# obscure URL is a crude but workable authentication method

import db_connector/db_sqlite, strutils

var db {.threadvar.}: DbConn

db = open("foo.db", "", "", "")

let version = try:
  parseInt(db.getValue sql"SELECT version FROM version")
except DbError:
  db.exec sql" PRAGMA journal_mode=WAL "
  db.exec sql" PRAGMA busy_timeout = 30000 "
  0

db.exec sql" BEGIN "

if version < 1:
  # use sqlite's fast-and-practical mode
  # this is good enough for most web app needs

  # create tables
  db.exec sql" CREATE TABLE version (version INT) "
  db.exec sql" INSERT INTO version (version) VALUES (0) "
  db.exec sql" CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS foo (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT, foo string) "

db.exec sql"UPDATE version SET version=1"

db.exec sql" COMMIT "


```

Then you can initialize the database and run the example program a few times.


```
$ curl localhost:2347/initdb-av0k2ja15v2347rbwchexz48.nim
$ curl localhost:2347/sqlite.nim
1	dsaf
$ curl localhost:2347/sqlite.nim
1	dsaf
2	safd
$ curl localhost:2347/sqlite.nim
1	dsaf
2	safd
3	sadf
```

This is a perfectly suitable starting point for a production web app. You may want to run the migration script on the command line, or use more advanced authentication.

Personally, I prefer the typed tiny_sqlite.

```
nimble install tiny_sqlite
```

.. warning::
  For security, keep your database files out of the web root.

.. info::

  A convenient way to do that is to start pharao from a current working directory that is not in the web root, such as /var/lib/pharao, and use relative paths such as "foo.db".


```

Limitatons
----------

.. info :: There is a [Nim compiler bug](https://github.com/nim-lang/Nim/issues/19071) the author was unable to work around that prevents pharao files from having their own type definitions, they have to be put into imports. Sorry!

```nim
# /var/www/types.nim
type
  FooObj = object
    bar: int
  Foo = ref FooObj

var foo = Foo(bar: 123)

body.add $foo.bar
body.add "\n"
```

```
$ curl localhost:2347/imp.nim
Error: inconsistent typing for reintroduced symbol 'foo'
$ # whoops
```

Until there is a fix, import your types as a workaround

```nim
# /var/www/onlytypes.nim
type
  FooObj* = object
    bar*: int
  Foo* = ref FooObj
```

```nim
# /var/www/imptypes.nim
import onlytypes

var foo = Foo(bar: 123)

body.add $foo.bar
body.add "\n"

```

```
$ curl localhost:2347/imptypes.nim
123
```


Useful examples
---------------

The most obvious use for pharao are quick throwaway scripts. Those are very very important, because they tend to evolve into more useful applications over time- and every little bit of friction you don't have makes you reach for your programming language more to solve problems. This is the main point why the author made pharao.

Here are some small but real-world examples.

**Fancy Email collect form **

This is the motivating example for pharao. Having a quick form to collect some data should be easy.

This is the fancy old-school version: It redirects with a cookie-based one-time message on success.

```nim
# /var/www/collect.nim
import times, uri, sequtils,tables
if request.httpMethod == "POST":
  let f = open("/tmp/collect.tsv", fmAppend)
  let vars = request.body.decodeQuery.toSeq.toTable
  f.writeLine($now(),vars.getOrDefault("name", "-"), vars.getOrDefault("email", "-"))
  f.close
  code = 302
  headers["Set-Cookie"]="OnetimeMessage=Thank you, your email address " & vars["email"] & " was collected."
  headers["Location"] = request.path
  body = "redir"
else:
  body = """
<!DOCTYPE html>
<form method="post" action="">
  <script>
  (function () {
    // read cookie
    var onetimeMessage = (document.cookie + ";").match(/OnetimeMessage=(.*);/)[1]
    console.log(onetimeMessage)
    if (onetimeMessage) {
      document.currentScript.insertAdjacentHTML("afterend", "<p>"+onetimeMessage+"</p>")
      document.cookie = "OnetimeMessage=; expires=Thu, 01 Jan 1970 00:00:00 UTC;" // Remove cookie
    }
  })()
  </script>
  <legend>
    Please type in your name and email address
  </legend>
  <input type="Name" name=name placeholder="Name">
  <input type="text" name=email placeholder="Email">
  <input type="submit">
</form>
"""
```

Run in production
-----------------

The easiest way and most secure way to run pharao on a Linux web server is with systemd. You can get an isolated system with its own user by creating the file below. systemd will create an isolated state directory in /var/lib/pharao for you, so if you open a database "foo.db" it will go into /var/lib/pharao/foo.db and be accessible only by the pharao user.


```
# /etc/systemd/system/pharao.service
[Unit]
Description=pharao
After=network.target httpd.service
Wants=network-online.target

[Service]
DynamicUser=True
ExecStart=pharao
Restart=always
NoNewPrivileges=yes
PrivateDevices=yes
PrivateTmp=yes
ProtectHome=yes
ProtectSystem=full
Environment=PHARAO_WWW_ROOT=/var/www
Environment=PHARAO_LOG_LEVEL=INFO
Environment=PHARAO_LOG_PATTERN=[$2] $3
StateDirectory=pharao
WorkingDirectory=%S/pharao

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

And then running and enabling the service

```
$ systemd daemon-reload
$ systemd start pharao
$ systemd enable pharao
```

Check it works

```
systemd status pharao
```

Check logs

```
journalctl -u pharao --since '5 minutes ago'
```

Trace logs

```
journalctl -u pharao --since '5 minutes ago' -f
```

Other ways to run daemons may of course be used.


Reverse proxy configuration
---------------------------

Most of us like to run web applications with a public facing reverse proxy server that handles SSL and static files, passing apprequests to our program

This uses the same mechanism as a PHP setup to only run .nim files through pharao, let nginx handle static files. You still benefit from Nim's superior performance.

```
# /etc/nginx/sites-available/example.org
server {
  server_name example.org;
  listen 80;
  listen [::]:80;
  root /var/www/example.org;
  access_log /var/log/nginx/example.org.access.log;
  error_log /var/log/nginx/example.org.error.log;

  index index.html index.htm index.nim;

  location / {
    try_files $uri $uri/ /index.nim$is_args$args;
  }

  location ~ \.nim$ {
    proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:2347;
    proxy_buffering off;
    proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Host $host;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Port $server_port;
  }
}
```

Something I like to do is have a few domains where each subdomain has a directory for even more convenience. You create directory and file `/var/www/_.example.org/foo/bar.nim` and can call it at `curl foo.example.org/bar.nim`.

```
server {
  listen 80;
  listen [::]:80;
  
  server_name ~^(?<subdomain>.+)\.example\.org$;
  if (!-d /var/www/_.example.org/$subdomain) {
    return 444;
  }
  root /var/www/_.example.org/$subdomain;
  access_log /var/log/nginx/$subdomain.example.org.access.log;
  error_log /var/log/nginx/$subdomain.example.org.error.log;

  index index.html index.htm index.nim;

  location / {
    try_files $uri $uri/ /index.nim$is_args$args;
  }

  location ~ \.nim$ {
    rewrite ^/(.*)$ /$subdomain/$1 break;
    proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:2347
    proxy_buffering off;
    proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Host $host;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Port $server_port;
  }
}

```

```
# add this line to pharao.service
Environment=PHARAO_WWW_ROOT=/var/www/_.example.org
```

You may of course use any reverse proxy you like.

Combine this with a wildcard SSL certificate and you can create new sites extremely easily.

You can use [certbot](https://certbot.eff.org/) to get SSL certificates.

Pharao uses the mummy webserver which is so good it's the reason pharao seemed worth making. Thanks!!!

About
-----

Pharao acts as a source for the mummy webserver. And... the source... of a mummy... is a pharaoh! *Boom-tss*

And a pharaoh have much in common with PHP! Both start with the letters P and H, lord over vast empires, and are deformed by excessive inbreeding.
